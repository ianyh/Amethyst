# Custom Layouts (beta)

Amethyst supports implementing custom layouts via JavaScript.

## Installing

Layouts are located in `~/Library/Application Support/Amethyst/Layouts/`. This directory is automatically created when Amethyst is first launched. JavaScript files in this directory will automatically be picked up and keyed by the name of the file; e.g., `my-cool-layout.js` will be available as a layout with the key `my-cool-layout`.

At the moment, files must be manually moved to this directory. There is no way to import them through the app.

## Defining a Layout

At the root of the file you must define a function named `layout`. This function should return an object with the following properties.

### Layout Properties

#### `name`

A string defining the name of the layout. If no name is specified it will default to the layout key.

#### `initialState`

An object defining any initial state to be tracked by the layout.

#### `commands`

An object defining the commands the layout responds to. Currently, there are four available commands keyed as `command1`, `command2`, and so on. Commands are objects with a `description` string to describe what the command does and an `updateState` function.

The `updateState` function takes two arguments—`state` and `focusedWindowID`—and must return a new state object.

* `state`: the current layout state
* `focusedWindowID`: the currently focused window

#### `getFrameAssignments`

A function that takes three arguments—`windows`, `screenFrame`, and `state`—and returns a mapping of window ids to window frames.

* `windows`: the list of active windows on the screen
* `screenFrame`: the frame of the screen containing the layout
* `state`: the current layout state

The return should be an object with _new_ frames keyed by the window id.

#### `updateWithChange`

A function that takes two arguments—`change` and `state`—and must return a new layout state based on the provided change.

* `change`: the particular change the layout needs to respond to.

### Common Structures

#### Windows

A window is an object with three properties.

* `id`: an opaque identifier for referencing the window both within `getFrameAssignments` and across the layout state
* `frame`: the current frame of the window in the screen space
* `isFocused`: boolean for whether or not the window is currently focused

#### Frames

A frame is an object with four properties.

* `x`: x-coordinate in the screen space
* `y`: y-coordinate in the screen space
* `width`: pixel width
* `height`: pixel height

Note that frames are in a global space, not relative to a given screen.

#### Changes

A change represents the outcome of an event in the system. It is an object with up to two properties.

* `change`: the string key of the type of event (see below)
* `windowID`: the window id for relevant changes
* `otherWindowID`: the second window id for relevant changes

Current changes are:

* `"add"`: a window has been added to tracking
    * Has a `windowID` for the new window
* `"remove"`: a window has been removed from tracking
    * Has a `windowID` for the removed window
* `"focus_changed"`: the currently focused window has changed
    * Has a `windowID` for the newly focused window
* `"window_swap"`: two windows have been swapped in position
    * Has a `windowID` for the first window and an `otherWindowID` for the second window
* `"application_activate"`: an application has been activated
    * No parameters
* `"application_deactivate"`: an application has been deactivated
    * No parameters
* `"space_change"`: the current space on a screen has changed
    * No parameters
* `"layout_change"`: the layout of a screen changed
    * No parameters
* `"unknown"`: an unknown event
    * No parameters

## Examples

There are several layouts defined for automated tests that can serve as examples. They are in [AmethystTests/Model/CustomLayouts/](../AmethystTests/Model/CustomLayouts/).
