 *
 * The CLS_LOG macro provides as easy way to gather more information in your log messages that are
 * sent with your crash data. CLS_LOG prepends your custom log message with the function name and
 * line number where the macro was used. If your app was built with the DEBUG preprocessor macro
 * defined CLS_LOG uses the CLSNSLog function which forwards your log message to NSLog and CLSLog.
 * If the DEBUG preprocessor macro is not defined CLS_LOG uses CLSLog only.
 *
 * Example output:
 * -[AppDelegate login:] line 134 $ login start
 *
 * If you would like to change this macro, create a new header file, unset our define and then define
 * your own version. Make sure this new header file is imported after the Crashlytics header file.
