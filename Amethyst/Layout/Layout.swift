 A base class for specific layout algorithms defining size and position of windows.

 Specific layouts must subclass and override the following properties and methods:

 Subclasses can optionally override `layoutDescription` to provide debugging information for the layout state.

 Usage of a layout object requires specifying a `WindowType` parameter.
