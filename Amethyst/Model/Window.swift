     The tolerance for error is necessary as for performance reasons we avoid performing unnecessary frame assignments, but some windows (e.g., Terminal's windows) have some constraints on their size such that `frame` and `window.frame()` will differ by some small amount even if `frame` has been applied before. We want to treat that frame as equivalent if it is close enough so that we get the performance benefit.
