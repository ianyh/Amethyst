@class AMLayout;

// Abstract superclass for defining layout behavior of windows on a screen.
// 
// Layouts are conceptually organized as a main pane of content and a secondary
// pane of content. The main pane of content contains some adjustable, non-zero
// number of windows. The size of the main pane and the number of windows
// contained in it may be adjustable or may be static depending on the layout
// algorithm.
//
// For example the fullscreen layout has a main pane whose size always fills the
// screen and whose count is always 1, but the tall layout has a main pane on
// the left of the screen whose size can be adjusted and the number of windows
// contained there can be increased and decreased.
